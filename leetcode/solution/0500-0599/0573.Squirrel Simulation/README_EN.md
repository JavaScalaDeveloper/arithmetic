# [573. Squirrel Simulation](https://leetcode.com/problems/squirrel-simulation)

[中文文档](/solution/0500-0599/0573.Squirrel%20Simulation/README.md)

## Description

There's a tree, a squirrel, and several nuts. Positions are represented by the cells in a 2D grid. Your goal is to find the <b>minimal</b> distance for the squirrel to collect all the nuts and put them under the tree one by one. The squirrel can only take at most <b>one nut</b> at one time and can move in four directions - up, down, left and right, to the adjacent cell. The distance is represented by the number of moves.

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
Height : 5
Width : 7
Tree position : [2,2]
Squirrel : [4,4]
Nuts : [[3,0], [2,5]]
<b>Output:</b> 12
<b>Explanation:</b>​​​​​

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>All given positions won't overlap.</li>
	<li>The squirrel can take at most one nut at one time.</li>
	<li>The given positions of nuts have no order.</li>
	<li>Height and width are positive integers. 3 <= height * width <= 10,000.</li>
	<li>The given positions contain at least one nut, only one tree and one squirrel.</li>
</ol>

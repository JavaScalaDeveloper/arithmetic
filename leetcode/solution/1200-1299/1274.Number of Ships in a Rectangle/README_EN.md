# [1274. Number of Ships in a Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-ships-in-a-rectangle)

[中文文档](/solution/1200-1299/1274.Number%20of%20Ships%20in%20a%20Rectangle/README.md)

## Description

<p><em>(This problem is an <strong>interactive problem</strong>.)</em></p>

<p>On the sea represented by a cartesian plane, each ship is located at an integer point, and each integer point may contain at most 1 ship.</p>

<p>You have a function <code>Sea.hasShips(topRight, bottomLeft)</code> which takes two points as arguments and returns <code>true</code> if and only if there is at least one ship in the rectangle represented by the two points, including on the boundary.</p>

<p>Given two points, which are the top right and bottom left corners of a rectangle, return the number of ships present in that rectangle.  It is guaranteed that there are <strong>at most 10 ships</strong> in that rectangle.</p>

<p>Submissions making <strong>more than 400 calls</strong> to <code>hasShips</code> will be judged <em>Wrong Answer</em>.  Also, any solutions that attempt to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.</p>

<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
ships = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[5,5]], topRight = [4,4], bottomLeft = [0,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
<strong>Explanation:</strong> From [0,0] to [4,4] we can count 3 ships within the range.
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>On the input <code>ships</code> is only given to initialize the map internally. You must solve this problem "blindfolded". In other words, you must find the answer using the given <code>hasShips</code> API, without knowing the <code>ships</code> position.</li>
	<li><code>0 <= bottomLeft[0] <= topRight[0] <= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>0 <= bottomLeft[1] <= topRight[1] <= 1000</code></li>
</ul>

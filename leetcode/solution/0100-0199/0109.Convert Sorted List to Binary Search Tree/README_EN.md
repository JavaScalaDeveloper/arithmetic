# [109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree)

[中文文档](/solution/0100-0199/0109.Convert%20Sorted%20List%20to%20Binary%20Search%20Tree/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.</p>

<p>For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of <em>every</em> node never differ by more than 1.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>

Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],



One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:



      0

     / \

   -3   9

   /   /

 -10  5

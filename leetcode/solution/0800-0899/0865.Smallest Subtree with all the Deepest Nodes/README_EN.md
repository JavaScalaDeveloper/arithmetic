[中文文档](/solution/0800-0899/0865.Smallest%20Subtree%20with%20all%20the%20Deepest%20Nodes/README.md)

## Description

<p>Given a binary tree rooted at <code>root</code>, the <em>depth</em> of each node is the shortest distance to the root.</p>

<p>A node is <em>deepest</em> if it has the largest depth possible among&nbsp;any node in the <u>entire tree</u>.</p>

<p>The subtree of a node is that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.</p>

<p>Return the node with the largest depth such that it contains all the deepest nodes in its subtree.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>

<strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">[3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]</span>

<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">[2,7,4]</span>

<strong>Explanation:

</strong>



We return the node with value 2, colored in yellow in the diagram.

The nodes colored in blue are the deepest nodes of the tree.

The input &quot;[3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 0, 8, null, null, 7, 4]&quot; is a serialization of the given tree.

The output &quot;[2, 7, 4]&quot; is a serialization of the subtree rooted at the node with value 2.

Both the input and output have TreeNode type.

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of nodes in the tree will be between 1 and 500.</li>
	<li>The values of each node are unique.</li>
</ul>

# [759. Employee Free Time](https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-free-time)

[中文文档](/solution/0700-0799/0759.Employee%20Free%20Time/README.md)

## Description

<p>We are given a list <code>schedule</code> of employees, which represents the working time for each employee.</p>

<p>Each employee has a list of non-overlapping <code>Intervals</code>, and these intervals are in sorted order.</p>

<p>Return the list of finite intervals representing <b>common, positive-length free time</b> for <i>all</i> employees, also in sorted order.</p>

<p>(Even though we are representing <code>Intervals</code> in the form <code>[x, y]</code>, the objects inside are <code>Intervals</code>, not lists or arrays. For example, <code>schedule[0][0].start = 1</code>, <code>schedule[0][0].end = 2</code>, and <code>schedule[0][0][0]</code> is not defined).  Also, we wouldn't include intervals like [5, 5] in our answer, as they have zero length.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> schedule = [[[1,2],[5,6]],[[1,3]],[[4,10]]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[3,4]]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are a total of three employees, and all common
free time intervals would be [-inf, 1], [3, 4], [10, inf].
We discard any intervals that contain inf as they aren't finite.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> schedule = [[[1,3],[6,7]],[[2,4]],[[2,5],[9,12]]]
<strong>Output:</strong> [[5,6],[7,9]]
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 <= schedule.length , schedule[i].length <= 50</code></li>
	<li><code>0 <= schedule[i].start < schedule[i].end <= 10^8</code></li>
</ul>

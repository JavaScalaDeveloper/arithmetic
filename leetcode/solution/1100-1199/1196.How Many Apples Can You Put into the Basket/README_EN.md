## Description

<p>You have some apples, where <code>arr[i]</code> is the weight of the <code>i</code>-th apple.  You also have a basket that can carry up to <code>5000</code> units of weight.</p>

<p>Return the maximum number of apples you can put in the basket.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr = [100,200,150,1000]
<strong>Output:</strong> 4
<strong>Explanation: </strong>All 4 apples can be carried by the basket since their sum of weights is 1450.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr = [900,950,800,1000,700,800]
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<strong>Explanation: </strong>The sum of weights of the 6 apples exceeds 5000 so we choose any 5 of them.
</pre>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 <= arr.length <= 10^3</code></li>

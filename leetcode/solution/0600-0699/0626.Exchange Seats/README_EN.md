[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0626.Exchange%20Seats/README.md)

## Description

<p>Mary is a teacher in a middle school and she has a table <code>seat</code> storing students&#39; names and their corresponding seat ids.</p>

The column <b>id</b> is continuous increment.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Mary wants to change seats for the adjacent students.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

Can you write a SQL query to output the result for Mary?

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>

+---------+---------+

|    id   | student |

+---------+---------+

|    1    | Abbot   |

|    2    | Doris   |

|    3    | Emerson |

|    4    | Green   |

|    5    | Jeames  |

+---------+---------+

</pre>

For the sample input, the output is:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>

+---------+---------+

|    id   | student |

+---------+---------+

|    1    | Doris   |

|    2    | Abbot   |

|    3    | Green   |

|    4    | Emerson |

|    5    | Jeames  |

+---------+---------+

</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />

If the number of students is odd, there is no need to change the last one&#39;s seat.</p>

# [648. Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words)

[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0648.Replace%20Words/README.md)

## Description

<p>In English, we have a concept called <code>root</code>, which can be followed by some other words to form another longer word - let&#39;s call this word <code>successor</code>. For example, the root <code>an</code>, followed by <code>other</code>, which can form another word <code>another</code>.</p>

<p>Now, given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the <code>successor</code> in the sentence with the <code>root</code> forming it. If a <code>successor</code> has many <code>roots</code> can form it, replace it with the root with the shortest length.</p>

<p>You need to output the sentence after the replacement.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> dict = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;bat&quot;, &quot;rat&quot;]

sentence = &quot;the cattle was rattled by the battery&quot;

<b>Output:</b> &quot;the cat was rat by the bat&quot;

</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
    <li>The input will only have lower-case letters.</li>
    <li>1 &lt;= dict words number &lt;= 1000</li>
    <li>1 &lt;= sentence words number &lt;= 1000</li>
    <li>1 &lt;= root length &lt;= 100</li>
    <li>1 &lt;= sentence words length &lt;= 1000</li>
</ol>

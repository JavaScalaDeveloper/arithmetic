[中文文档](/solution/0600-0699/0673.Number%20of%20Longest%20Increasing%20Subsequence/README.md)

## Description

<p>

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.

</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> [1,3,5,4,7]

<b>Output:</b> 2

<b>Explanation:</b> The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />

<pre>

<b>Input:</b> [2,2,2,2,2]

<b>Output:</b> 5

<b>Explanation:</b> The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.

</pre>

</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>

Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.

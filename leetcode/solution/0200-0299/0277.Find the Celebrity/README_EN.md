# [277. Find the Celebrity](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-celebrity)

[中文文档](/solution/0200-0299/0277.Find%20the%20Celebrity/README.md)

## Description

<p>Suppose you are at a party with <code>n</code> people (labeled from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>) and among them, there may exist one celebrity. The definition of a celebrity is that all the other <code>n - 1</code> people know him/her but he/she does not know any of them.</p>

<p>Now you want to find out who the celebrity is or verify that there is not one. The only thing you are allowed to do is to ask questions like: "Hi, A. Do you know B?" to get information of whether A knows B. You need to find out the celebrity (or verify there is not one) by asking as few questions as possible (in the asymptotic sense).</p>

<p>You are given a helper function <code>bool knows(a, b)</code> which tells you whether A knows B. Implement a function <code>int findCelebrity(n)</code>. There will be exactly one celebrity if he/she is in the party. Return the celebrity's label if there is a celebrity in the party. If there is no celebrity, return <code>-1</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

![](./images/277_example_1_bold.png)

<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong>graph = <span id="example-input-1-1">[
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [1,1,1]
]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">1</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>There are three persons labeled with 0, 1 and 2. graph[i][j] = 1 means person i knows person j, otherwise graph[i][j] = 0 means person i does not know person j. The celebrity is the person labeled as 1 because both 0 and 2 know him but 1 does not know anybody.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

![](./images/277_example_2.png)

<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong>graph = <span id="example-input-2-1">[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-2">-1</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>There is no celebrity.
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The directed graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, which is an <code>n x n</code> matrix where <code>a[i][j] = 1</code> means person <code>i</code> knows person <code>j</code> while <code>a[i][j] = 0</code> means the contrary.</li>
	<li>Remember that you won't have direct access to the adjacency matrix.</li>

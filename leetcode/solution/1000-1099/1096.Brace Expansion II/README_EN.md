# [1096. Brace Expansion II](https://leetcode.com/problems/brace-expansion-ii)

[中文文档](/solution/1000-1099/1096.Brace%20Expansion%20II/README.md)

## Description

Under a grammar given below, strings can represent a set of lowercase words. Let's use `R(expr)` to denote the set of words the expression represents.

Grammar can best be understood through simple examples:

- Single letters represent a singleton **set** containing that word.
  - `R("a") = {"a"}`
  - `R("w") = {"w"}`
- When we take a comma delimited list of 2 or more expressions, we take the union of possibilities.
  - `R("{a,b,c}") = {"a","b","c"}`
- When we concatenate two expressions, we take the set of possible concatenations between two words where the first word comes from the first expression and the second word comes from the second expression.
  - `R("{a,b}{c,d}") = {"ac","ad","bc","bd"}`
  - `R("a{b,c}{d,e}f{g,h}") = {"abdfg", "abdfh", "abefg", "abefh", "acdfg", "acdfh", "acefg", "acefh"}`

Formally, the 3 rules for our grammar:

    - For every lowercase letter x, we have `R(x) = {x}`
    - For expressions `e_1, e_2, ... , e_k` with `k >= 2`, we have `R({e_1,e_2,...}) = R(e_1) ∪ R(e_2) ∪ ...`
    - For expressions `e_1` and `e_2`, we have `R(e_1 + e_2) = {a + b for (a, b) in R(e_1) × R(e_2)}`, where + denotes concatenation, and × denotes the cartesian product.

Given an `expression` representing a set of words under the given grammar, return the sorted list of words that the expression represents.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "{a,b}{c,{d,e}}"
Output: ["ac","ad","ae","bc","bd","be"]
```

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= expression.length <= 60`
2. `expression[i]` consists of `'{'`, `'}'`, `','` or lowercase English letters.
3. The given `expression` represents a set of words based on the grammar given in the description.

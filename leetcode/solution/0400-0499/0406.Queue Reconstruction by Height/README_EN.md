[中文文档](/solution/0400-0499/0406.Queue%20Reconstruction%20by%20Height/README.md)

## Description

<p>Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers <code>(h, k)</code>, where <code>h</code> is the height of the person and <code>k</code> is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to <code>h</code>. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.</p>
